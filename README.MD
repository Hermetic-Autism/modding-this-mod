im dumb and didnt know how this works. i assumed that valheim was using the github link in the manifest file to pull all of the code from the mod off this page. that is the reason i made a reupload of all this code is because i wanted to make a slight change in the code and link back to here in the manifest file, that is not how this works. i also do not know how to remove the mod clone off of thunderstore. but if you installed that version of the mod and are reading this then just uninstall it and go get the original instead cause this doesnt change anything.
